Blocksright: [{"content":{"text":"<p>ABOUT THE TRACK</p><hr><p>Emilia Álvarez propels us into a planetary-cosmic future with <em>Neon Hyperglossia</em>, an audiovisual work where creation and transformation intertwine. The piece begins by erasing the words of selected authors, leaving only punctuation in place. These stripped-down marks expose the texts’ underlying rhythms, becoming the basis for a new musical score. Each symbol is interpreted sonically, assigned its own tone and tempo—on screen, they shimmer like distant stars.&nbsp;</p><p>Borrowing its name from the medical term for an oversized tongue,<em> Neon Hyperglossia</em> reimagines language as expansive, unstable, and mutating. Alvarez draws on thinkers like Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui, Sara Ahmed, Donna Haraway, and Fabio Zerpa to explore language as a contested site—where power, identity and meaning collide. The result is a constellation of voices, codes, and impossible signs, which Álvarez describes as ‘a cosmic rave of resistance and reinvention’.</p>"},"id":"2d093b78-0cd7-4a0d-8f14-1f20e1acffcf","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
