Infoartist: <p>The final track comes from musician, composer, and vocalist Plumm, who crafts an evocative journey using the sound of her voice, but without words. At times solo, at times layered, the piece showcases the raw power and range of the human voice — both literal and metaphorical.&nbsp;</p><p>Recorded in varied states — after running, meditating, upon waking, and before sleep — the work captures the voice in moments of vulnerability, relaxation and transition. The only word to arrive at the very end signals surrender and triumph at once.&nbsp;</p><hr><p>Plumm is a vocalist, composer, multi-instrumentalist and bandleader hailing from South London, England, with a Welsh core. Plumm’s sound is dark, ethereal, alternative, trip-hop, electronic, eerie, improvisational and vocal-heavy. Her song,You Are The One Live, is the title track for Apple TV's new series Liaison. Catch her as Jamz Supernova’s ‘After Dark Discovery’ and Clash Magazine's 'one-to-watch'.</p>
