Blocksright: [{"content":{"text":"<p>ABOUT THE TRACK</p><hr><p>Ideology and its casualties take centre stage in Boston’s former Poet Laureate Porsha Olayiwola’s searing piece. A scathing indictment of events that occured on US soil from August 2022 to today, the poem names and honours those who bear the cost of extreme ideology. While the poet draws a sharp line between victims and perpetrators, her final line — rich with double meaning — leaves us questioning how any of us might be swayed, or corrupted, under pressure.</p><p><em>(Dedication)<br>After June Jordan, After Audre Lorde</em><br>&nbsp;</p>"},"id":"f6949a72-ca59-47db-8a24-2c658132707f","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"items":[{"itemheader":"<p>TRANSCRIPT</p>","itemcontent":"<p>&nbsp;<br>we must speak about the cities<br>that have become cemeteries<br>at the glitch of a finger<br>&nbsp;</p><p>we must speak about the families<br>and all their generations dead<br>and blotted out like a rotting stain<br>&nbsp;</p><p>we must speak about the sixth grader<br>who ended her life for fear she would<br>be dragged back across a border<br>&nbsp;</p><p>we must speak about the soldier<br>who set himself on fire in front of<br>the embassy in protest of genocide<br>&nbsp;</p><p>we must speak about the drones like<br>an army of birds, teaching the kinder-<br>garteners to count by counting ghosts<br>&nbsp;</p><p>we must speak about the woman in the pink<br>head scarf walking &amp; then carried by men<br>in masks and thrown in an unmarked government van<br>&nbsp;</p><p>we must speak about the palestinian man<br>arrested by a country of criminals<br>his wife, reduced to a puddle of pleas<br>&nbsp;</p><p>we must speak about the brick of the<br>university’s sidewalk that does not come clean<br>of blood pouring from the bodies of students<br>&nbsp;</p><p>we must speak about amber thurman<br>who died two weeks after the abortion ban<br>because the doctors feared for their lives<br>&nbsp;</p><p>we must speak about the doctors<br>dragged from courtrooms, and the women<br>dragged from courtrooms and the queers<br>&nbsp;</p><p>dragged from courtrooms and the courtrooms,<br>a cemetery, we must speak about the navajo man<br>detained and questioned about his citizenship,<br>&nbsp;</p><p>we must speak about the man berated on television<br>ridiculed and under attack for defending<br>his people who are ridiculed and under attack<br>&nbsp;</p><p>we must speak about the slew of fires and floods<br>the whole education department banned away<br>the cities that have become cemeteries<br>&nbsp;</p><p>at the hands of men who are religious<br>to the gods they have become<br>we must speak of the land of fangs and blades<br>&nbsp;</p><p>the world with hands reaching like the claw<br>of a hanger—a border closing in on our throat<br>a gag and muzzle around our mouth<br>&nbsp;</p><p>of sugar—everything we marched for<br>got marched over with an order<br>they have made this a lawless land<br>&nbsp;</p><p>so we need the law of revolution<br>this dark comedy of “countries”<br>this shaky sinister laugh of leaders pledging<br>&nbsp;</p><p>to carry us to the casket if we let them<br>silence is an opportunist<br>silence is violet pooling on cement<br>&nbsp;</p><p>let me be clear we have no choice<br>but to color our palms red. let me be clear,<br>we must invocate the drums<br>&nbsp;</p><p>we must incite the ancestors<br>we must go out singing<br>we must go down swinging a dagger<br>&nbsp;</p><p>we must go out screaming, in a fight for our lives<br>ours nails and knuckles clogged with the flesh<br>of our enemies who have made our cities<br>&nbsp;</p><p>into graveyards — we must go out biting the neck<br>of white supremacy, we must got out gauging<br>out the eyes of facism with our teeth—mouth full<br>&nbsp;</p><p>of righteousness, mouth full of blood, skin and cartilage<br>we must ravish triumphant oh lord, in order to survive,<br>these brutes we have had to become</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"}]},"id":"dbd5d29c-ef79-400c-bf34-f1ad917672af","isHidden":false,"type":"accordion"}]
