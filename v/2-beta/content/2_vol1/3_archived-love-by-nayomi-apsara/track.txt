Blocksright: [{"content":{"text":"<p>ABOUT THE TRACK</p><hr><p><em>Archived Love, </em>the first poem on the album by Nayomi Apsara, is a triptych that spans personal, political and philosophical terrain, offering a meditation on longing, memory and emotional aftermath. Rooted in the tension between love and melancholy, desire and ideology, each poem explores a facet of love’s persistence: the mourning caused by a lover’s renunciation (<em>Tree of Verses</em>), the residue left by a lover who chooses revolution over relationship (<em>Comrade, You Left Me for Us!</em>), and the quiet reclamation of self in the wake of accepting impermanence (<em>Periphery of Love</em>). Together, they form a living archive where love transcends nostalgia, and becomes a force for transformation and radical vulnerability. The “Tree of Verses” stands as both metaphor and monument: a space where poetry bears witness to the lives and loves we’ve known, and the questions we still carry.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>TRANSCRIPTS<br>&nbsp;</p>"},"id":"e72326b0-8a60-41c0-ba22-a46a3d7f70ab","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"items":[{"itemheader":"<p><em>Archived Love</em></p>","itemcontent":"<p>The Tree of Verses by Nayomi Apsara</p><p>I kiss our unborn children every day, my beloved,<br>As they sleep on our beds and divans unmade.<br>I let the windows open, doors wide<br>Hoping to drift away like a wind-tossed leaf&nbsp;<br>despite the burden of being, being without you.&nbsp;<br>With the memories woven beneath the stars,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>braided into my once loved long hair.</p><p>Your breath no longer stirs this home, my beloved,<br>Should I shake the world to bring you home?

My beloved,<br>When I remain, with a body still warm.&nbsp;<br>I place offerings at your feet,<br>every day, in the hush of dawn,&nbsp;<br>I sweep the temple grounds,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>I scatter jasmines from our garden,&nbsp;<br>that you will not see,&nbsp;<br>Hoping the smell will bring you home.</p><p>In a million years’ time, my beloved,<br>We will meet again under the sparkle of some dead stars,<br>Like complete strangers,&nbsp;<br>carrying empty bags full of beautiful memories made,<br>when the dead stars were alive,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>You will know me at ‘Hello’.</p><p>Until then, my beloved,<br>I will plant a tree of verses.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Because, a love like ours is rare to bloom<br>Once again, in a lifetime.</p>"},{"itemheader":"<p>Comrade, You left me for us!</p>","itemcontent":"<p>It was never about me, was it?&nbsp;<br>Not these idle hands, ink-stained,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>nor the slow-brewed tea left steaming on your manifesto, <br>still warm, you slipped away into the cause,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>leaving behind the echo of your absence,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>as if I were nothing but the golden dust of your past,&nbsp;<br>‘rationally’ swept aside.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The soft university nights in the quadrangle <br>your body leaned close, but your mind miles away<br>I read Neruda’s aching words to the back of your head,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>your thoughts lost in revolution,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>your hands more accustomed to rallying than holding me,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>your fingers scrawling slogans on the inside of my wrists,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>I, too soft, too quiet, caught between <br>the warm touch and the coldness of your ideals.&nbsp;</p><p>“Tomorrow, my love,” you said,&nbsp;<br>buttoning your sweaty ‘comrade’s’ shirt,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>your voice trembling with the fire you wore,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\"There will be no 'you' or 'me' only ‘us’,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>the voice of the unrepresented,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>the dreams of the barefoot and the forgotten,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>those who have never tasted the comforts&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>of books and tea!”&nbsp;</p><p>Do you remember our last night, after the riot,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>I wore silk and you wore blood,&nbsp;<br>you came to me bruised,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>your voice hoarse from chanting,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>and I poured us a drink?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>You tasted the fumes of tear gas, I tasted whiskey,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>a luxury you mocked<br>and yet, you drank it, didn’t you?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>You drank with the same hands that clutched the flag&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>you swore to raise above us all,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>and for a moment, it was just you and me,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>and the taste of something finer than the fire in your eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Did you find comfort in that glass?&nbsp;</p><p>I waited behind, tending the ‘Tree of Verses,’&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>out by the old library wall, where the air was still,&nbsp;<br>untouched by protest where you once whispered your ideals&nbsp;<br>as I sat in my silk.<br>It has grown nicely, you’d be pleased to know,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>a modest canopy, a place to sit alone,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>the roots have learned to anchor themselves,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>and I do not miss you, not in the way you might expect.</p><p>They said you were brilliant, they said you were brave,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>they said you kissed death on the lips,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>while I kissed the dust of pages turned,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>and in the process, we abandoned the delicate kiss of love.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Revolution is a jealous mistress,&nbsp;<br>I still walk the quadrangle,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>my sari drapes echoes of your slogans.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>And I, a quiet part of your desires,<br>a living casualty of your greater love.</p>"},{"itemheader":"<p>Periphery of Love</p>","itemcontent":"<p>Loving and loved&nbsp;<br>in abundance?
