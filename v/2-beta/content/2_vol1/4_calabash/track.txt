CALABASH is a sonic invocation that brings together Indigenous traditions across the world.

A vessel, a symbol, a cosmic container.&nbsp;</p><p>[womb like watery space]</p><p>From this sacred vessel, all things came to be.&nbsp;</p><p>The fire (Ina), the water (Omi), the earth, and the sky.&nbsp;</p><p>The pulse of existence, beating in every ripple.&nbsp;</p><p>Aṣé.</p><p>Listen…</p><p>Listen, and you will hear the first sound, the first vibration, rising from the calabash.&nbsp;</p><p><em>MODUPE: Omi tutu</em></p><p>It is the sound of creation, of ancestors speaking through time.&nbsp;</p><p>In the beginning, the calabash held the water.&nbsp;</p><p>The first drop, the first breath.&nbsp;</p><p>The calabash carried it all: the stillness before life, the waves that birthed the land, the tears of the first beings, the laughter of the spirits.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Aṣé.</em></p><p>The calabash is a symbol of balance, where water (Omi) and fire (Ina), creation and destruction, life and death, exist in harmony.&nbsp;</p><p>The strength to carry the water (Omi) and the fire (Ina) comes from the power of the forge, from the balance between these forces.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Aṣé.</em></p><p>Here the calabash speaks. It speaks in rhythm, in beat, in <em>oriki</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>It speaks in the language of the drum, the language of the body.&nbsp;</p><p>It holds us, connects us, guides us.</p><p>In the calabash, we are all reflections of one rhythm, one sound, one sacred breath.</p><p><em>Aṣé</em>&nbsp;</p><p>The calabash is not only sacred to the Yorùbá; it is revered across the globe.&nbsp;</p><p>Among the ancient Egyptians, the gourd was a symbol of the divine, holding the waters of creation and the harvests of the earth.&nbsp;</p><p>In the Andes, the gourd is honoured as a symbol of fertility, life, and continuity.&nbsp;</p><p>The <em>mate</em> gourd is used in sacred ceremonies to carry the essence of offerings, serving as a vessel of energy, of divine balance.&nbsp;</p><p>In the African diaspora, the calabash remains a living symbol of ancestral connection, of the sacred link between the living and the spirit world.</p><p>In Native American cultures, the gourd is deeply revered as a sacred vessel of transformation.&nbsp;</p><p>Among the Hopi and Pueblo peoples, the gourd is seen as a symbol of the earth’s nurturing power, representing fertility, growth, and the cyclical nature of life.&nbsp;</p><p>The gourd is often used in ceremonies to hold sacred substances or as a tool for rituals that connect the community to the land and to each other. <em>Omo, omo,</em> we carry the sacred teachings passed down by the gourd.</p><p>In ancient Chinese traditions, the gourd, known as the <em>hulu</em>, was considered a powerful symbol of protection and abundance.</p><p>The gourd in Chinese culture is also linked to immortality, representing the infinite potential of life.&nbsp;</p><p>The calabash holds us, and we, in turn, hold the calabash.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Aṣé.</em>&nbsp;</p><p>Omi O, MODUPE</p><p>Calabash, sacred vessel of life,<br> In your hollowed form, the world is held,<br> Through your shape, we see the divine reflected,<br> The first drop, the first breath,<br> You are the container of all existence,<br> Water (<em>Omi</em>) and fire (<em>Ina</em>),<br> Creation and destruction,<br> Balance and harmony within your form.</p><p>&nbsp;<em>Aṣé</em></p>"}]},"id":"f63e8d7c-3deb-4cd4-894c-3f894cd7ed05","isHidden":false,"type":"accordion"}]
