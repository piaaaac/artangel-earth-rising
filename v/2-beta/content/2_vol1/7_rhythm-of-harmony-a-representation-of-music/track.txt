Blocksright: [{"content":{"text":"<p>ABOUT THE TRACK</p><hr><p>Max Cooper explores how easily we take sound for granted by composing a piece with extraterrestrial listeners in mind. How might aliens hear — if they hear at all — what we do? Beginning with finger clicks and handclaps, Cooper layers electronic textures that build into a soundscape fit for the climax of a sci-fi epic. At its core, the piece reflects a deeply human impulse: the empathetic attempt to imagine another being’s experience of a reality we assume as given.</p>"},"id":"eec1cd25-8f5d-46f9-ae57-49c67e1022de","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
