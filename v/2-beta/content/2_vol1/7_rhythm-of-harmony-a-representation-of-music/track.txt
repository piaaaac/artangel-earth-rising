Infoartist: <p>Max Cooper explores how easily we take sound for granted by composing a piece with extraterrestrial listeners in mind. How might aliens hear — if they hear at all — what we do? Beginning with finger clicks and handclaps, Cooper layers electronic textures that build into a soundscape fit for the climax of a sci-fi epic. At its core, the piece reflects a deeply human impulse: the empathetic attempt to imagine another being’s experience of a reality we assume as given.</p><hr><p>Max Cooper is an audio-visual pioneer and non-conformist with a PhD in Computational Biology which informs his explorations at the intersection of music, science and art. His multimedia collaborations with scientists, mathematicians, architects, coders, designers, directors and visual artists creates audio- visual performances, installations and films. Max tours internationally, presenting shows and experiences at landmarks including the Acropolis in Athens and performing at major music and arts festivals around the world. Max Cooper has collaborated with Zaha Hadid Architects, Dolby, L-Acoustics, 4DSOUND, Barbican Centre, The Babraham Institute and exhibited work at museums including the Pompidou Metz, V&amp;A London, ZKM Karlsruhe, Museum Wave Seoul and The Science Museum London.</p>
