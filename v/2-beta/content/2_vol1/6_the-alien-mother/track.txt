Blocksright: [{"content":{"text":"<p>ABOUT THE TRACK</p><hr><p>The album’s only short story, <em>The Alien Mother</em> by Michel Nieva, weaves together many of its central themes through the lens of a mother’s love for her son in a society where cruelty and bureaucracy are inseparable. Set in a future where humanity has colonised Mars and dehumanisation is routine and unremarkable; the story’s sci-fi surface reveals deep parallels with the lived experiences of many migrant communities today. Despite its otherworldly setting, Nieva’s narrative is grounded in urgent, familiar truths. <em>The Alien Mother</em> is read in English and presented in Spanish as a bonus track.<br>&nbsp;</p>"},"id":"870b08f5-eac7-4bc8-be43-eab314e604d9","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"items":[{"itemheader":"<p>TRANSCRIPT</p>","itemcontent":"<p>&nbsp;<br>The alien mother<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Victorica, Argentina, 2075</p><p>‘Excuse me, son, is this the queue for migrating to Mars?’, the woman asked the boy at the back of the line. The tall, polarized glass building that housed the Martian Migration Embassy’s Visa Office rose up before them.</p><p>It was over fifty degrees, and the midday air was a thick, dusty soup that made breathing a struggle. The lady (let’s clarify, without any further ado, that her name was Leonora) was walking tortuously with her shopping cart (in which she carried the endless ridiculous documents required for the interview as well as her shopping from the greengrocer’s and the grocery shop).&nbsp; As the cart whirred and clicked, its movement hindered by mangled wheels, Lenora stumbled upon the absurd queue for applicants, more than five blocks in length.</p><p>‘Excuse me, son, is this the queue for migrating to Mars?’ With her piercing voice she once again addressed the boy at the back of the line, a gangly teenager who was flailing in the greasy soup of the afternoon and who nodded unenthusiastically in response. Leonora’s figure cut a clear contrast with that of most of the other applicants. Her pace slow and trembling, her hair silver with the snowfall of time, Leonora was nearing eighty. To a stranger’s eyes, she would certainly have been considered an ‘older woman’. It had been six months since she’d last heard from her son Roberto, who had migrated two years earlier to the Southern Mining Provinces (the Martian colony for extraction of rare earths where the majority of the Latin American community was based). Concerned by her boy’s silence (he may have been a forty-five-year-old man but he was still her son) and also slightly alarmed by the knowledge that she had only a few chances left to see him in her lifetime, she undertook the arduous process of getting a visa. If Mars wouldn’t come to mother, then mother would go to Mars. Warned by doctors that this could be her last opportunity, since over-eighties were advised against flying into space, she presented herself as a candidate to the Martian Migration Embassy’s Visa Office, as if sending a message in a bottle over the ocean. She never imagined that within just two months she would receive the following message in the post:&nbsp;</p><p>Dear Leonora K.</p><p>Congratulations. You have been granted an appointment for an alien 4 category Martian visa.</p><p>And now here she was with her shopping cart, joining this enormous queue which largely consisted of young men between fifteen and thirty, kids just like her son, all motivated by the vague, abstract hope of a new life outside Earth. But despite the adverts, which sold a fantasy of a greater destiny on Mars and showed off the delights of Terminus, a kind of Martian Dubai where the multimillionaires had all ended up and where luxury and comfort reigned, the reality for common people who, having no future on Earth, had migrated to try their luck elsewhere, turned out quite differently. The majority, as mentioned, were based in the Southern Mining Provinces, where the working conditions were awful and the terraforming process was either in its early stages or non-existent. Her son Roberto, back when he still used to call her, told her how unpleasant the weather in the mines was becoming, with winds of up to 150km/hour, nighttime temperatures that dipped as low as -200°C and dust storms that lasted weeks. Then there was the clause in the migration contract that prohibited returning to earth.</p><p>What’s more, there was the extremely tedious migratory process, which, using insecurity and unemployment as an excuse, was getting harder and harder for Latin Americans. In the specific case of Argentina, the ‘red cards’ for permanent residency had been suspended and replaced by the ‘alien’ visa system, which neither guaranteed Martian citizenship, nor the human rights once enjoyed on Earth, offering instead temporary leave to remain which required renouncing the legal and juridical frameworks granted by any nationality or planetary gender, and which was only granted to 30% of applicants.</p><p>And so, given the slow and complicated nature of the process, huge crowds would pound at the doors of the Office in the hope of becoming legal aliens. As she waited, Leonora witnessed the crowds of dejected people leaving the office, some even weeping, no doubt because their applications had been denied, their only opportunity for a better future in ruins because they were missing some insignificant scrap of paper or had not given the correct answer to a question on the form.</p><p>She put on the glasses hanging around her neck and frowned at her watch: 12:30. Her slot was at 1. She could feel the unrelenting midday heat, a sun that could make oil fry at ambient temperatures.&nbsp;</p><p>‘Even the lizards don’t come out at this hour,’ she moaned out loud. It took her at least a month to gather the papers requested, during which she spent all her savings. Interminable forms and sworn declarations with incomprehensible questions surrounding her renunciation of humanity, a medical certificate proving she was capable of withstanding Mars’s radioactivity and aridity, pharmacists’ receipts for all the antibiotics needed to fight Martian bacteria, receipts for vaccines, travel tickets, hotel reservations, among other paperwork, all of it stamped by a notary and issued with an apostille by the Ministry of Space Relations, with double copies attached.</p><p>As she was checking through her copious documentation, dragging her cart behind her, her turn to enter arrived.</p><p>The security guard standing at the door stopped her.</p><p>‘Excuse me, madam, you can’t come in with that shopping cart.’</p><p>‘But it’s just for my shopping.’</p><p>Leonora undid the cord and opened it to show him its contents: eggs, meat, flour, a kilo of aubergines and some tomatoes.</p><p>‘I’m sorry, madam, it’s for security reasons.’</p><p>Leonora looked at the shopping cart with its violet leopard print cover. In truth, leaving the cart (it had a broken wheel which made it extremely arduous to pull along) bothered her far less than losing the ingredients for that evening’s dinner, but she resigned herself to the guard’s intransigence and handed it to him.</p><p>One she had cleared the high doors and the first metal detector, she was perplexed by the labyrinthine structure of the Martian Migration Embassy Visa Office. The entrance hall branched off into multiple corridors, so dimly lit that they blurred into a murky horizon of doors and diversions. She tried to decipher the signs, which presumably clarified where each corridor led, but they were a mess of arrows and other incomprehensible symbols.</p><p>‘Excuse me young man, is this way for alien visa applications?’ she asked the gangly teenager walking ahead of her, but he either did not hear her or chose not to respond. She decided to follow him to a room with small lockers along the walls in which everyone left their keys, wallets, phones, water bottle, hats, belts, even their shoes, along with the other bits and pieces in their pockets, since it was strictly forbidden to enter with any object other than the official documents. Leonora placed her keys and espadrilles in one of the cubicles, and she was about to shut it and continue following the gangly teen when she realized that the lockers need a one-peso coin to work. She patted the pockets of her pink and orange flower-print dress.</p><p>‘For fuck’s sake…’ she lamented out loud. Ever since she had begun to consider herself a non-young person (that was the euphemism she used to refer to her age), she almost never dropped F-bombs, but this time her impotence overwhelmed her. She had left her coin purse outside in the violet leopard print shopping cart. Her hands shook. What to do? Would she lose her place if she went back to find it?</p><p>She turned round, nervous and agitated, as two enormous security guards unexpectedly blocked her way.</p><p>‘Where are you going, madam? You can’t turn back, you must follow the arrows on the ground. It’s for security reasons.’</p><p>Leonora noticed there were frenzied arrows on the floor, heading off in every direction.</p><p>‘Bu-but, I, I…’ The poor woman was so nervous it made her stutter. ‘I forgot my purse outside and I don’t have a peso for the locker,’ she finally managed to say, almost breathless.&nbsp;</p><p>‘If you leave the premises, you’ll lose your place in the visa queue, the one assigned to you months or possibly years ago. In this case, the best thing is to head to STAB,’ the guard said.</p><p>‘Where?’ the old lady wondered.</p><p>‘To the Security Token Allocation Bureau. There you will be supplied with a replacement token for the locker. It’s the fourth door on the right,’ the guard said, pointing in that direction.</p><p>Intimidated by the man’s imposing hand, Leonora walked in the direction indicated. After just a few metres she felt the dull, grimy tiles beneath her feet and remembered she had left her espadrilles in the locker. She turned to go back and get them, but the guards were standing there with their arms crossed, waiting for her to continue.&nbsp;</p><p>‘You can’t go back, madam. You must follow the arrows.’</p><p>She took the curve to the right and found herself in a new waiting room. There were two old men (much older than her, almost decrepit), sitting on a bench.</p><p>‘They’re waiting for you, madam,’ the older of the two men commented, using his stick to point the way.</p><p>Leonora entered the office and, behind a reinforced glass window, a female worker asked through a microphone:&nbsp;</p><p>‘What is the reason for your visit?’</p><p>‘I came to look for a security token to put my things in the locker.’</p><p>‘Where are your things?’</p><p>‘In the locker.’</p><p>‘What do you want the token for if your belongings are already there?’</p><p>‘So I can lock it… it’s for security reasons,’ Leonora insisted, thinking this expression, used by other staff, would persuade her.</p><p>‘The Martian Migration Embassy Visa Office is one of the safest places in the country,’ the woman asserted, as if offended by Leonora’s insinuation. ‘There is no way anyone could steal another person’s belongings from a locker, even when it’s left open. It has never happened.’</p><p>The woman looked at Leonora. She wasn’t very tall, but if you’d followed her steps from the beginning of the current process, you would have noted an odd change, as if she’d curved over or shrunk. Her eyes were half-shut and her mouth remained open, totally focused on the increasingly arbitrary obstacles being imposed on her. The woman noticed she was holding some papers under her arm and asked to see them. She questioned her as she leafed through them.</p><p>‘What is the reason behind your application for a type 4 alien visa?’</p><p>‘I’m going to visit my son,’ Leonora answered.</p><p>The more precise answer, the one that had impelled her to take this journey, was that she didn’t want to die without seeing her son for the last time, but the unforeseen vertigo caused by the process had distanced her from the urgent proximity of her death.</p><p>‘And what job does your son do in the Mining Provinces?’</p><p>‘He’s a perforations operator in a cerium and neodymium mine. I haven’t heard from him in eight months, and I want to know how he is.’</p><p><em>Dead, surely,</em> the employee thought, as she continued to check the papers disdainfully. Almost no one survived the toxic vapours in the rare earth mines of the Mining Provinces for more than a year. Then, she gave an order:</p><p>‘Sing the anthem, please.’</p><p>This requirement was a formality with which nearly every alien visa interview began. No matter the type of visa or its duration, it was obligatory to memorize the anthem of the Southern Mining Provinces.</p><p>Leonora sang:</p><p>Hear, Martians, your pickaxes held high</p><p>Excavate, Perforate, Drill down straight!</p><p>Hear, in the sweet din of pneumatic drills</p><p>The red streak of&nbsp; noble minerals</p><p>Now the Southern Mining Provinces</p><p>Have launched their most worthy rocket</p><p>And the great mines of Mars do reply:</p><p>Noble folk of the mines we salute you!</p><p>Noble folk of red Mars we salute you!</p><p>And the great mines of Mars do reply:</p><p>Noble folk of the mines we salute you!</p><p>Noble folk of red Mars we salute you!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Leonora paused to breathe and, somewhat nervously, since singing was far from her greatest talent, repeated the chorus, one, twice, three times, before belting out the rest of the verses, which she’d learnt especially for the interview. The secretary, after listening in rapt attention to the private concert, to which she had given a few satisfied looks of approval, inspected the woman’s ID:</p><p><em>Name: Leonora K.</em></p><p><em>Date of Birth: 03/07/1996</em></p><p>The secretary looked at Leonora’s wrinkled and tired face, looked back at the ID and scratched her head. 78? How had they granted a type 4 alien visa to an old woman who was unlikely to withstand the abrasive Martian radiation for a single day?</p><p>She thought for a moment before making up her mind.</p><p>‘Listen here, madam. In cases like this one, we offer an alternative service to those applying for alien conversion to get a type 4 visa. Because of your age, it’s highly likely your body would not survive the rocket’s violent descent into the fragile Martian atmosphere. Have you ever heard about the alien xv-2000 visa?’</p><p>‘But I’m only 78, the limit’s 80, I still qualify,’ Leonora objected.&nbsp;</p><p>The secretary went on, like she hadn’t heard her:</p><p>‘Because migrants often miss&nbsp; family members who will never be financially able to fly into space, SpaceZ launched an economical clone breeding service. Despite not actually being the subject in question, said clones are considered complete legal replacements for the copied person.’ The secretary took a moment to check Leonora understood, but she seemed perturbed. She continued regardless: ‘The clones are mutants, gestated from the cells of the replicated specimen and transgenic pig embryos, genetically modified to tolerate Martian radiation and aridity. Once the creature is engendered, the face and anatomical protuberances are moulded using the precise measurements and genetic profile of the individual being copied. The xv-2000’s neuronal system integrates all the necessary linguistic information (from their text message history to emails and videos) so that it can simulate their personality, voice and response patterns. Finally, the alien xv-2000 is sent by mail to the client’s postal address and paid for in affordable and sustainable instalments.’</p><p>‘But I want to visit my son!’ Leonora burst out, striking the counter weakly and impotently. ‘Is that so hard to understand? Didn’t I pay for all the permissions, authorizations and applications? Don’t I have the right to visit my son for the last time before I turn 80?’</p><p>‘I understand, madam. But it will be far more productive for your son to receive this product than an old lady with fragile bones and flaccid muscles. In the highly unlikely case your body survives the journey, it will be in such a pitiful state that your son will have to spend all his time caring for you. You may need months of recovery, if you recover at all, and your son will lose his job, since no one can be absent from the cerium and neodymium mines for that long. Do you want to help the poor lad or totally screw up his already wretched life in the toxic Martian mines?’</p><p>Leonora listened like she wasn’t there. In no way was she seriously contemplating the option of the clone. As well as being absurd and surely very expensive, she really wanted to see her son. But when the employee mentioned the care she would potentially require on arrival, she was alarmed. What would happen if she travelled and, owing to some tragic circumstance, had to be cared for like a sick patient, becoming a burden to her son?</p><p>After thinking about it for a while, she asked, with a mixture of reticence and curiosity:</p><p>‘All right, then. Can I see one of these organisms?’</p><p>‘Of course. But this is the Security Token Allocation Bureau, and&nbsp; in no circumstances are we authorized to sell or breed xv-2000 aliens. To do that, you must visit the Bureau for Cloning and Registry of Extraterrestrial Identities. Go straight through this hall all the way to the end, turn left, then right, right again and again, take a U-turn, and you’ll reach your destination.</p><p>Leonora obeyed. She advanced down the deep corridor indicated by the secretary. She considered how, with all that artificial light and no windows, it was impossible to tell if it was still day or if it was now night. She hadn’t brought her watch either, having left it behind in the locker. She wondered how much time could have passed since her appointment had begun.</p><p>Three hours?</p><p>Five?</p><p>Nine?</p><p>Fourteen?</p><p>Suddenly, the strangest idea came to her. What if this whole tedious and seemingly endless process was part of a secret ritual to turn applicants, that is, her, into aliens. In other words, once she was completely and utterly rid of her humanity, she would receive the visa and could go and visit her son. So, being barefoot, being hungry and thirsty, having tired legs and feeling thoroughly confused were all part of a protocol, the meaning of which was still unknown to her but which she would discover once she had got to the end of the labyrinth. She continued towards the right. Then she turned right again, as the employee had told her to do. She felt a piercing pain in her spine and stopped to rest. She remembered reading somewhere that most of the extraterrestrials discovered to date walked around on four legs. What if she crawled? Not only would the quadruped position ease her lumbar, it would also accelerate the transformation. She lowered her hands to the floor and her entire perspective changed. She crawled for a few metres. A new idea crossed her mind, one she could not avoid expressing out loud:</p><p>‘Today is a happy day on Mars!’</p><p>Or rather, today her son was a happy man in the rare earth mines on Mars. He cracked and split open the hard rock, uncovering nuggets of cerium and neodymium from amongst the rubble and, after the careful process of chemical purification, sold the extremely pure minerals, before enjoying a spectacular evening on the thriving, prosperous red planet, as he eagerly awaited his mother’s arrival. She crawled around for five minutes more, made the U-turn as she had been told to do until she reached some leather boots waiting for her. She looked up.</p><p>‘Leonora K?’ the employee, looking at her from above like a bronze statue, asked.</p><p>Leonora nodded.</p><p>‘Welcome to the Department for Cloning and Registry of Extraterrestrial Identities. Your alien xv-2000 is now ready!’</p><p>Leonora shot him a confused look from the floor.</p><p>‘But didn’t you decide to let me travel in the end?’</p><p>From up high, the employee replied:</p><p>‘Mrs K, we have received express orders to generate your clone, which has just been born. Lamentably, once born it is a baby, a little living creature which we cannot eliminate. To exterminate it would constitute a homicide, an offence punishable under Martian law with up to 10 years in prison. Before taking any hasty decision, I implore you to watch yourself taking your first steps.’</p><p>The clone entered. How to explain the horror Leonora felt before this aberration of matter, inconceivable to her eyes which, accustomed to earthly biology, now stood out on stalks? The foetus, half human and half porcine, was a jumble of hairy flesh which dragged itself a long, leaving a viscous trail of milky oil in its wake. But the worst thing was not the sinister, indecipherable crossbreeding of specimens that evolution had&nbsp; discounted as inviable or useless but the fact that, from its feeble and premature little body, a clear adult head hung limply, one identical to Leonora’s, with wrinkled skin and long grey hair, sprouting a drooling, toothless mouth that gushed out foam and whimpered in a baby voice:</p><p>‘Love, master, mommy.’</p><p>‘I love you, dear Roberto.’</p><p>Still on the floor, Leonora looked at the employee in terror: ‘What is this aberration?’</p><p>‘Don’t worry, Mrs K., what you see here is just the foetus, the clone in its newborn state. The face is almost identical, but we still have to prosthetically mould the rest of the body according to your anatomical and linguistic measurements. However, this is the simplest stage in the process, one that will take place as the mutant undertakes its long journey to Mars. Now, the legal part. To expedite the clone, we need you to declare under oath your alien condition and the ceding of your legal Martian personhood to the xv-2000.’</p><p>‘But I thought you were going to let me travel, not this monster!’ Leonora cried again, visibly upset.</p><p>Growing impatient, the guard interrupted her complaint by taking a step towards her.</p><p>‘Listen, Mrs K., can’t you see that the clone’s creation is irreversible? If you don’t allow it to be sent, you won’t even be able to interact with your son via video, using the cameras contained in the xv-2000’s head. Now, listen and answer me. Do you swear to become an alien?’</p><p>Leonora did not respond. The guard gave her a menacing look:</p><p>‘Do you or do you not swear to become an alien?’</p><p>‘Yes, I swear.’</p><p>‘And do you swear to extend those attributes to this mutant, so that it can represent you on Mars not just legally as a person but as the putative mother of Roberto K., mineral extraction licence holder N° 94309756?</p><p>‘Yes, I swear.’</p><p>‘Louder!’</p><p>‘Yes, I swear!’</p><p>‘Well done. Congratulations, Leonora, the process is over and this mutant, as your representative, will visit your son in the Southern Mining Provinces.’ He handed her a small cardboard box. ‘Here is a video screen on which you will be able to monitor your xv-2000’s journey and eventually adopt its point of view when it is reunited with your son.’</p><p>Aided by the guard, Leonora got up from the floor and took the cardboard box. The guard also gave her some papers and pointed her to the exit, which was far simpler than the intricate labyrinth she had traversed so far. She followed the arrows on the floor to the locker, keen to collect her belongings and get out of there. But when she got to the entrance hall, she met three guards waiting in front of her open locker. She saw that one of them was holding her violet leopard print shopping cart by the handle.</p><p>‘What’s the matter, gentlemen, is there a problem?’ she asked, a little shaken.</p><p>The three men looked at her with poker faces.&nbsp;</p><p>‘Open the cart, please,’ one of the guards ordered.</p><p>A sudden paranoia shot through her. What if they’d planted drugs or firearms and wanted to frame her as a terrorist? After all, at spaceports they always urged you not to leave your baggage unattended for that very reason. One of the justifications for toughening the conditions for Latin Americans to migrate to Mars had been accusations that they were bringing terrorism, crime and drugs…</p><p>After hesitating briefly, she replied:</p><p>‘I’m sorry, sir, but I would prefer not to. I left the cart at the entrance to the building when I began the process, who knows how long ago, and I fear someone could have put explosives, narcotics or other substances that are strictly forbidden on Mars into it…’</p><p>‘Open it!’ the guard shouted.</p><p>Terrified, Leonora pulled the cord to open the shopping cart.</p><p>‘Remove the products from inside and list them one by one,’ the guard ordered.</p><p>Leonora extracted the first plastic bag, showed it to him and said:</p><p>‘Two tomatoes.’</p><p>She removed the second bag:</p><p>‘Four aubergines.’</p><p>Then, at the bottom, Leonora picked up a paper package. The guards came closer and raised their shotguns. Leonora raised the package, dripping with oil. She diligently unwrapped the paper and displayed the sticky, yellow slices, veined with pink streaks of fat which, owing to the extreme heat, were sweating out a thick, fetid petrol.</p><p>‘What is it?’ one of the guards asked, pointing at the slices.</p><p>‘Luncheon meat. Two hundred grammes.’</p><p>‘Luncheon meat!’ the guard shouted. ‘Just as I suspected. Didn’t you know that, owing to the current Martian Porcine Plague alert, it is strictly forbidden to enter Mars or its interplanetary institutions on earth with pork products? Didn’t you know that the alien xv-2000 is made from pork fat, a noble transgenic fat resistant to radiation and aridity, and its survival is currently endangered by this plague?’</p><p>Leonora’s heart began to pound. She remembered how, in one of the many absurd sworn declarations she had signed, she had committed to neither consuming nor handling pork products for two months prior to the journey. But among all the regulations and paperwork she had completely forgotten about it.&nbsp;</p><p>‘You don’t want your xv-2000 to be denied alien status or lose your chance to see your son via video transmission, do you?’</p><p>‘No, sir, please!’ Leonora begged.</p><p>‘Then never come back to our building with pork products, and leave these offices immediately, before we arrest you!’ the guard shouted as he tore the package from her hands, threw it to the floor and trampled on it.</p><p>Leonora clumsily put her espadrilles on, grabbed her things and fled in anguish, almost running. When she emerged, as if she’d forgotten what planet she lived on, the greasy soup of the evening restored her to the Pampas Caribbean. She began the walk to her house, as she peered at the sky and sought out the pale light of Mars among the smog and stars. Roberto was up there, so far, far away. In the depths of night, she wondered what he could be doing, to which activity from his Martian daily routine, forbidden to her, he was devoting himself. What would he have for dinner today? With unexpected bitterness, she remembered how part of her plan had been to visit him on his birthday. Would he get on well with her clone? Would they celebrate together?&nbsp; She raised up the box&nbsp; she was carrying beneath her arm and decided she would turn on the screen when she got home. She’d watch the live transmission of her mutant’s journey to Mars. Perhaps that way, through the alien xv-2000, she could reestablish contact with her son, find out how he was and talk to him, if only at a distance.</p><p>‘Today is a happy day on Mars!’ she told herself and took the sweltering path back home, beneath the starlit skies of the Pampas Caribbean.&nbsp;</p>"}]},"id":"61e2e1e1-2f89-44b5-bd27-2e88e6e495b5","isHidden":false,"type":"accordion"}]
